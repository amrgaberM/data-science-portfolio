## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [injury-prediction-prevention-ml](https://github.com/amrgaberM/injury-prediction-prevention-ml)
Injury Prediction and Prevention is a sophisticated web application designed to help athletes and coaches reduce sports injury risks through advanced machine learning and tailored recommendations. Powered by an ensemble of RandomForest and XGBoost models, it predicts injury risk levels (Low, Medium, High) with ~92% accuracy, analyzing factors like training intensity, fatigue, and injury history. The app features a Cohere-powered chatbot for injury-related queries and a sleek web interface for seamless interaction, making it an essential tool for sports professionals.
