## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Customer Churn Prediction](./customer-churn-ml/)
A supervised machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn using classification techniques such as Random Forest. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### 🔹 [House Price Estimation (Streamlit App)](./house-price-streamlit/)
An interactive application built with Streamlit that predicts house prices based on user-inputted property features. The app is designed for ease of use and is suitable for testing with real-world data.

### 🔹 [News Category Classification (BERT)](./news-classifier-bert/)
A natural language processing project utilizing a fine-tuned BERT model to classify news articles into predefined categories. The project includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of classification performance.

## 🧪 Mini Projects

The [`data-science-mini-projects/`](https://github.com/amrgaberM/data-science-mini-project) directory contains compact yet insightful explorations that demonstrate core data science techniques:

- [zomato-eda-analysis](https://github.com/amrgaberM/data-science-mini-projects/tree/main/zomato-eda-analysis): This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data to explore ratings, costs, and service types using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- [Covid-19-EDA](https://github.com/amrgaberM/data-science-mini-projects/tree/main/Covid-19-EDA): This project analyzes and visualizes COVID-19 data to explore the spread, impact, and trends of the pandemic across different countries and regions.

Each project contains a README file that explains the context, tools used, and how to run or explore the work.
